                You understand and agree that in Blueciate' sole discretion, and without prior
                notice, Blueciate may terminate your access to the Site, cancel your order or

                or the law. You agree that monetary damages may not provide a sufficient remedy

              <h3>General Provisions</h3>
              <p>
                a. These Terms constitute the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the
                subject matter hereof. No waiver by Blueciate of any breach or default
                hereunder
                shall be deemed to be a waiver of any preceding or subsequent breach or default.
              </p>
              <p>
                b. The Content may contain typographical errors or other errors or inaccuracies
                and may not be complete or current. Blueciate therefore reserves the
                right to
                correct any errors, inaccuracies or omissions and to change or update the Content
                at any time without prior notice. Blueciate does not, however, guarantee
                that
                any errors, inaccuracies or omissions will be corrected.
              </p>

              <p>
                c. If there is any dispute about or involving the Site, by using the Site, you agree
                that the dispute will be governed
                by the laws of the State of New Jersey without regard to its conflict of law provisions.
                You agree to personal jurisdiction by and venue exclusively in the state courts
                of the State of New Jersey.
              </p>

              <p>
                d. If any part of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction
                to be invalid or unenforceable,
                it will not impact any other provision of this Agreement, all of which will
                remain
                in full force and effect.
